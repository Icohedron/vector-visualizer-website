                        <h3>Proposal</h3>
                        <h4>1. The Problem</h4>
                        <p>Vector math problems involving basic linear algebra. Vectors, matrices, and the possibility for quaternions as well.</p>
                        <h4>2. Purpose</h4>
                        <p>It can be used to educate people of some concepts behind linear algebra. It can be used to investigate how many graphics programs use vector math to make things move on screen. Since it is also a full vector math library, it can be used for making games and other projects that involve vector math.</p>
                        <h4>3. Audience</h4>
                        <p>Adults and students alike. (And some really intelligent children too!)</p>
                        <h4>4. Tools</h4>
                        <p>HTML/CSS/Javascript.</p>
                        <h4>5. Deliverables</h4>
                        <p>Open source (Javascript) and internal documentation to go along with it.</p>

                        <h4>Environment</h4>
                        <p>The environment will have a basic grid floor, have a mesh loaded in the center, and an easy-to-use interface for interacting with the mesh.</p>
                        <h4>Gameplay</h4>
                        <p>Although it is not a game, it still has first-person movement for flying around. This will allow users to see their manipulated mesh from any angle.</p>
                        <h4>Art</h4>
                        <p>The look and feel will be minimalistic. The design of the mesh itself will be, by default, simple as well. Of course, the mesh will be modifiable through the interface and .obj files will also be able to be loaded.</p>
                        <h4>Sound and Music</h4>
                        <p>There may be some ambient music playing in the background. It will have its own audio controller.</p>
                        <h4>User Interface, Controls</h4>
                        <p>The controls will be simple WASD, shift, and space movement. The user interface will be simple and easy to use HTML elements.</p>
